AMAZONIAN BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION REPORT

Annual Field Study Results 2024-2025

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report summarizes the findings of our 18-month biodiversity study conducted in the northwestern region of the Amazon rainforest. Our team of researchers documented 327 vertebrate species, including 42 that are currently listed as endangered or critically endangered according to IUCN Red List criteria. The study reinforces the urgent need for expanded conservation efforts in this critical ecosystem.
